Robot Karel
===============

As a semestral task for a subject teaching networking (BI-PSI) we had to implement a TPC server (RobotKarel.Server), TCP client (RobotKarel.Klient) and UDP client (RobotKarel.UdpMonoKlient) for a robot Karel. In the TCP part, Karel landed on a different planet and has to be navigated somewhere. He receives commands from a satellite (server) and moves towards a specified point.

In the UDP part, he sends pictures from the plannet back home.
